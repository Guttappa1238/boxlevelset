### Our method has been refined further and work better for various scenes comprehensively.  

The new paper is supervised by Prof. [Jianke Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SC-WmzwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Lei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tAK5l1IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) (PolyU, HK)
and is coming soon. The new code is based on **[MMdetection 2.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)**, and will come soon with pretrained models. 

  * The results of general dataset **COCO/VOC** are coming soon.
  * The results of medical dataset **LITS** are coming soon.

This code is for **Aerial Images**. Please see this paper ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03451.pdf)) for details. This code is based on **mmdet 1.0** (old version). 

## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/LiWentomng/boxlevelset/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for environment installation. This code is based on [AerialDetection](https://github.com/dingjiansw101/AerialDetection). 


## Getting Started
Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](https://github.com/LiWentomng/boxlevelset/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md) for **dataset preparation** and **model training and test**. 

## To Do
