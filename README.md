## Deep Levelset for Box-supervised Instance Segmentation
> Wentong Li, Yijie Chen, Wenyu Liu, Jianke Zhu*

This code is for **Aerial Images**. Please see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03451.pdf) for details.

**Any questions or discussions are welcomed!**

## News:
### Our method has been refined.
  * The results of general dataset COCO/VOC are coming.
  * The results of Medical dataset LITS are coming.

## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/LiWentomng/boxlevelset/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for environment installation. This code is based on [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [AerialDetection](https://github.com/dingjiansw101/AerialDetection). 


## Getting Started
Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](https://github.com/LiWentomng/boxlevelset/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md) for **dataset preparation** and **model training and test**. 

## Visualization
**Instance segmentation results only under the supervision of box annotations on iSAID dataset.**
