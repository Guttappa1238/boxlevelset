## To Do
* COCO dataset
* Medical images
* Text images


## Installation
This code is based on [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [AerialDetection](https://github.com/dingjiansw101/AerialDetection). Please refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/LiWentomng/boxlevelset/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for environment installation .


## Getting Started
Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](https://github.com/LiWentomng/boxlevelset/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the dataset preparation and basic usage. 

## Visualization
**Instance segmentation results only under the supervision of box annotations.**
